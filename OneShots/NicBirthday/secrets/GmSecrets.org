* Maze Nodes
** Start
All players are missing items that don't pertain to their secrets, they are all bound in ropes individually, arranged in a circle around a single knife.
*** Require Perception Roll for this!
    Two sleeping wolves are chained on opposing walls, with a blank wall South and a wooden door North
    Any noise speaking or louder will wake these wolves, they struggle against their chains to reach the party (ST 12, two successes breaks the chain from the wall)
    They have 5 HP each and will attack with bites (skill 12, 1d damage on hit)
*** If players take too long, the back wall begins to move forward, but allow easy escape through door (it's unlocked)
